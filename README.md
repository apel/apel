## Project overview

The APEL project provides grid accounting for EGI. It is written in 
Python and uses MySQL. It has the following components:

### apel-parsers

These extract data from the following batch systems:
* LSF
* PBS
* SGE/OGE
* SLURM
* HTCondor

and place it in the client database.

### apel-client

This processes the data and sends it to the APEL server using SSM.

### apel-server

This processes data from all sites and sends it on to the accounting 
portal using SSM.

### apel-lib

This contains all the library python code for apel-parsers, apel-client
and apel-server.

### apel-ssm

This is a messaging system, which has its own GitHub repository at 
[apel/ssm](https://github.com/apel/ssm)
