## The following information is necessary for 
## local jobs only.  Provide an average value for
## machines which your batch system uses.
## Supported specs are HEPSPEC and Si2k
## Provide also a hostname for your batch system.
## This does not need to be a definitive hostname,
## but it should uniquely identify the batch system.
## Example: pbs.gridpp.rl.ac.uk
#lrms_server = 
#spec_type = HEPSPEC
#spec_value = 1.0

## To manually set specs for all jobs (not just local ones), configure lines
## like the following named "manual_spec" followed by consecutive integers for
## however many batch systems are relevant. The value should be a unique name
## for the system, then the spec type ('HEPSPEC' or 'Si2k') and the spec value.
# manual_spec1 = grid10.uni.ac.uk:1234/grid10.uni.ac.uk-condor,HEPSPEC,10.0
# manual_spec2 = grid22.uni.ac.uk:1234/grid22.uni.ac.uk-condor,HEPSPEC,15.0
# manual_spec3 = grid35.uni.ac.uk:1234/grid35.uni.ac.uk-condor,HEPSPEC,15.0
