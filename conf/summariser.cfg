# Use stale_summary_window_days to limit the deletion of stale summaries to
# those reporting recent usage. This avoids deleting stale summaries that may
# be produced by deleting individual records regularly as part of an
# implementation of a long term retention policy.
#
# The recommended setting is that stale_summary_window_days should be set to
# twice the time between individual summariser runs to ensure the month
# boundary is handled correctly. i.e. 2 days if you summarise daily.
#
# The unit of stale_summary_window_days is days, though the cut off used will
# be rounded down to the start of the calendar month.
